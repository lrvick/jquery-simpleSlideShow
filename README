WHAT IS JQUERY-SIMPLESLIDESHOW?
    
    Because all the otehr jquery slideshows I could find were just too
    complex to use. 
    
    If all you really need is for some images to rotate for a banner or 
    something similar, this is for you.


CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Creates an infinite slideshow loop from a div containing image elements.

 * Contains working demo in demo folder

NOTES

    This uses a frozen snapshot of kral at known working commits, may not work
    with the latest commits of kral.
